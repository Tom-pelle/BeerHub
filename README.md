BeerHub is a Java Large Scale application created to help users explore the world of beer in a simple and engaging way.
The platform collects and integrates real data about beers, breweries, reviews and user profiles, offering a unified environment where exploration and interaction come together naturally.
Users can search for beers based on their personal preferences, read detailed profiles enriched with reviews, and follow breweries to stay connected with their favorite producers.
BeerHub also allows users to share their own opinions, making the experience more collaborative and community-oriented.
By observing user tastes and preferences, the application suggests beers, breweries and people who might match the user’s interests, making the discovery process easier and more personalized.

The goal of BeerHub is to provide a clean and intuitive experience that combines browsing, social interaction and personalized discovery within a single application.
The project integrates multiple data sources and leverages different NoSQL models to efficiently manage information and offer meaningful insights to the user.
